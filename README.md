- title: Code Driven Configuration
  details: Configure your entire Nova dashboard with simple PHP code. None of your Nova configuration is stored in the database. Painless to configure. Painless to deploy.
- title: Keeps Your Application Pure
  details: It’s a breeze to add a Nova administration panel to an existing Laravel application without touching your Eloquent models. After configuring a Nova resource for each model, you’re ready for lift off.
- title: Laravel + Vue.js = ❤️
  details: Nova is a sleek, single-page application built with Laravel and Vue.js. It's as smooth as silk and writing custom components is a cinch.
