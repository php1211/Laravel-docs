# Registering Lenses

[[toc]]

Once you have defined a lens, you are ready to attach it to a resource. Each resource generated by Nova contains a `lenses` method. To attach a lens to a resource, you should simply add it to the array of lenses returned by this method:

```php
/**
 * Get the lenses available for the resource.
 *
 * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
 * @return array
 */
public function lenses(Request $request)
{
    return [new Lenses\MostValuableUsers];
}
```
